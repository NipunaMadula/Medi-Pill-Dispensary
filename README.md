## Overview
Medi_Pill_Dispensary aims to reduce errors in medication dispensing while improving the efficiency of managing medical supplies. The system integrates:

- **Mobile Application**: Developed with Flutter, it allows patients and caregivers to track medication schedules and communicate with the system.
- **Web Interface**: Provides administrative control over inventory, medication details, and user accounts. This interface is also connected to Firebase for real-time updates.
- **Firebase Database**: Handles real-time data exchange between the mobile app, the web interface, and the Arduino hardware.
- **Arduino**: Controls the hardware to dispense pills based on scheduled times and commands received from the Firebase database.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: Tracks and updates medication stock automatically via Firebase, accessible from both mobile and web platforms.
- **Automated Pill Dispensing**: Ensures accurate and timely distribution of medication.
- **Mobile Notifications**: Sends reminders to patients and caregivers regarding medication schedules.
- **Web-based Management**: Provides admins with control over medication stock, distribution logs, and real-time updates, all connected through Firebase.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures that sensitive medical data is securely handled.
- **Firebase-Connected System**: Both the mobile app and web interface use Firebase to pass values to the Arduino hardware for accurate dispensing.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Mobile Application**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL (for the web interface)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hardware**: Arduino (with Firebase integration)
- **Database**: Firebase (for real-time data exchange between mobile, web, and Arduino)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter installed ([Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)).
- PHP and MySQL installed on your local machine.
- Firebase project set up ([Firebase Setup Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)).
- Arduino IDE for programming the hardware components.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NipunaMadula/Medi_Pill_Dispensary.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Medi_Pill_Dispensary
    ```
3. Install the Flutter dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4. Set up Firebase:
    - Create a Firebase project and add the necessary configuration files (google-services.json for Android, GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS).
    - Configure Firebase Realtime Database and set up rules for both mobile and web access.
5. Set up the database for the web interface:
    - Import the `db.sql` file into your MySQL database.
    - Configure the database credentials in the `config.php` file.
6. Connect the Arduino to Firebase:
    - Upload the Arduino code from the `Arduino Code` directory, which contains Firebase configuration to connect with both the mobile app and web interface.

## Usage

### Mobile App:
- Open the app on your mobile device to monitor medication schedules, receive notifications, and communicate with the Arduino system via Firebase.
- Register and log in to access your personalized dashboard.

### Web Interface:
- Admins can manage medication stocks, track user activity, and set dispensing schedules through the web interface. The interface is connected to Firebase for real-time updates and data sync.

### Hardware (Arduino):
- The Arduino will communicate with Firebase to receive commands for dispensing pills based on the schedule set from the mobile app or web interface.
